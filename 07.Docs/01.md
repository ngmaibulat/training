### Main Principle

- Document what you have learnt
- Configuration should be written, no clicked/typed
- What was written: docs, code, configs - must be stored in version control

### Infrastructure as Code

- Can be stored/reviewed/shared/improved easily
- Easy version control
- Easier to test
- Consistent results, compared to clicked/typed configuration
